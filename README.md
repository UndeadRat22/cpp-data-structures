Data structures in c++

All data structures use tempaltes, so they support any data type.
All data structures have a "Main.cpp" file where you can find usage examples.

This repository currently has:
- `Queue` (first in first out)
- `List` (first in last out)
- `Set` (a List of unique elements)
- `Dict` (a key, value pair vector, where every pair has to have a unique key)
